# my linux setup

This repo contains my dotfiles + setup for my Linux PCs.

## About

This Repo contains the config for my Desktop PC (`argentum`) and my Laptop(`silfur`).
Both are running Fedora Silverblue.
Since I used NixOS in the past (and still run it on my servers),
my whole terminal workflow is managed with home-manager, which lives in a toolbox.

## What's in this repo?

- `dotfiles`  
  general configuration files.
- `home-manager + home.nix`  
  home-manager submodule with my configuration.
- `logo.png`  
  🐧.
- `README.md`  
  You are reading this. :)
- `setup`  
  Install instructions + scripts I wrote down.
- `wallpaper.jpg`  
  The wallpaper I use.

## Why?

I don't know. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
