# my ArchLinux setup

## Some notes

I currently use Arch Linux with KDE Plasma as desktop environment.
I also used GNOME and Plasma with i3 as WM in the past.
I've recently tried out the nix package manager
and now manage most of my command line tools with it.
There is a separate repo you can find [here](https://github.com/clemak27/nix_setup).

## What's in this repo?

- `dotfiles`  
  Some symlinked dotfiles.
- `logo.png`  
  btw
- `other`  
  Some file that did'nt really fit into an other folder.
- `plasma`  
  Config for KDE Plasma.
- `README.md`  
  You are reading this :)
- `rofi`  
  Rofi dotfiles. I use one menu as app launcher and a second menu to select power options (shutdown, reboot, etc.)
- `scripts`  
  Scripts that don't really fit anywhere else.
- `sddm`  
  Config for the sddm display manager.
- `setup`  
  My (way too convoluted) scripts that install the system for me.

## Why?

I don't know. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
