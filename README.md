# my ArchLinux setup

## Some notes

I currently use Arch Linux with KDE Plasma as desktop environment.
I also used GNOME and Plasma with i3 as WM in the past.
I've recently tried out the nix package manager and now manage most of my command line tools with it.
There is a separate repo you can find [here](https://github.com/clemak27/nix_setup).

## What's in this repo?

- `dotfiles`  
  Some symlinked dotfiles.
- `logo.png`  
  btw
- `other`  
  Some file that did'nt really fit into an other folder.
- `polybar`  
  Polybar dotfiles
- `README.md`  
  You are reading this :)
- `rofi`  
  Rofi dotfiles. I use one menu as app launcher and a second menu to select power options (shutdown, reboot, etc.)
- `scripts`  
  Scripts that don't really fit anywhere else.
- `setup`  
  My (way too convoluted) script that installs the system for me.
- `test`  
  Basically a stupid test that check if all pacman packages I want to install during setup actually exist (to prevent typos etc.). When this repo was hosted on gitlab.com I ran this in CI, maybe I will setup a github action for that eventually.

## Why?

I don't know. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
