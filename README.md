# My Linux setup

This repo contains my dotfiles and setup for my Linux devices:

- `maxwell`: Desktop-PC
  - Runs Fedora Kinoite
  - Current Specs:
    - CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 9700X
    - GPU: AMD ATI Sapphire Radeon RX 6700
    - Board: MSI MAG B650 TOMAHAWK WIFI
    - Memory: 32 GB
    - Screens: 3440x1440 + 1920x1080
- `newton`: Dell XPS15 (7590)
  - Runs Fedora Kinoite
- `fermi`: Steam Deck
  - Runs bazzite
- `planck`: Pixel 8 Pro
  - Runs GrapheneOS + termux

This is for my own usage and preferences, but you are of course free to use it
as inspiration. I use chezmoi for managing my dotfiles. I could probably build a
custom image with all the additional setup I do, but I'm mostly satisfied how it
works for now.
