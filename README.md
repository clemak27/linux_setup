This repo contains my dotfiles + setup for my Linux PCs and my Steam Deck.

Both Desktop PCs are running Fedora Kinoite. The base system is managed with
`rpm-ostree`, GUI applications with flatpaks and my shell/terminal setup using
distrobox.

This is for my own usage and preferences, but you are of course free to use it
as inspiration.
