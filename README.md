This repo contains my dotfiles + setup for my Linux PCs.

## About

This Repo contains the config for my Desktop PC (`argentum`) and my
Laptop(`silfur`). Both are running Fedora Kionite and use Nix as package
manager. This means I have a base system and GUI applications that are
automatically updated, and a declarative terminal config for my tastes and
needs.

This is for my own usage and preferences, but you are of course free to use it
as inspiration.
