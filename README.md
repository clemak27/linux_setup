This repo contains my dotfiles + setup for my Linux PCs.

## About

This Repo contains the config for my Desktop PC (`argentum`) and my Laptop(`silfur`).
Both are running NixOS with KDE as Desktop Environment (although with a gnome-like workflow).

This is for my own usage and preferences, but you are of course free to use it 
as inspiration. Also, some of the setup-steps are potentially out of date.

## What's in this repo?

- `dotfiles`  
  some general configuration files.
- `hosts`  
  configuration file for each system
- `modules`  
  general configuration files
- `setup`  
  instructions and script to install systems
