# my linux setup

This repo contains my dotfiles + setup for my Linux PCs and my Steam Deck.

Both Desktop PCs are running Fedora Silverblue. The base system is managed with
`rpm-ostree`, GUI applications with flatpaks and my shell/terminal setup using
distrobox.

This is for my own usage and preferences, but you are of course free to use it
as inspiration.

`argentum` (Desktop-PC) has these specs:

- CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 2600
- GPU: AMD ATI Sapphire Radeon RX 6700
- Board: MSI B450M GAMING PLUS
- Memory: 16 GB
- Screens: 3440x1440 + 1920x1080

`silfur` is a Dell xps15 (7590).
