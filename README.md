# my linux setup

This repo contains my dotfiles + setup for my Linux Desktop PCs running Fedora Silverblue.

## About

I currently use Fedora Silverblue. I'm still new to it, so I use basically
a "god" toolbox, that contains the home-manager config of my previous NixOS
systems, so the initial transition is fast. I plan to do a more proper
setup later on. Also, the 2 systems running this configuration are `argentum`,
my general-use PC at home and `silfur`, a XPS15 (2019).

## What's in this repo?

- `dotfiles`  
  general configuration files.
- `home-manager + home.nix`  
  home-manager configuration files.
- `logo.png`  
  Fedora logo.
- `README.md`  
  You are reading this. :)
- `setup`  
  Install instructions + scripts I wrote down.
- `wallpaper.png`  
  The wallpaper I use.

## Why?

I don't know. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
