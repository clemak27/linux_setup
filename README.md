# my NixOS setup

this repo contains my dotfiles + setup for NixOS.

## What's in this repo?

- `home-manager`  
  home-manager configuration files, including user-customization of GNOME.
- `hosts`  
  The `configuration.nix` files for different machines:
  - `zenix`  
    My main PC I have at home.
  - `xps15`  
    My laptop. I'm not really satisfied with it,
    but also not motivated to replace it.
  - `rp3b`  
    A Raspberry Pi 3B. I currently use it for testing network stuff.
    Once I'm statisfied with that, I will probably switch
    my home-server to NixOS as well.
- `logo.png`  
  NixOS logo.
- `modules`  
  A collection of general nix modules the hosts can use.
- `README.md`  
  You are reading this.
- `setup`  
  Install instructions for NixOS.
- `wallpaper.png`  
  Custom made wallpaper cause I was bored once.

## Why?

I don't know. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
